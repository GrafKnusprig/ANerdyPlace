# That one time...

...I was on my desk drawing.

The battery of my battery powered eraser died and I hadn't any spare at hand.
So I thought: Why don't I have some manual holder for the eraser refills?

I stopped drawing, opened up blender and started modelling.
I measured the refills and player around with some cylindric shapes until I came up with a design I found good enough for a first testprint.

The first one was way to small. That happens to me a lot when modelling somethin out of my mind. I always underestimate how tiny these things come out of the printer.

So I made the second one much thicker.
It was way better. But still not the best.

I refined the design and added a litte storage room in the handle, as well as a plug for the end.
The plug has also the functionality to 'poke through' the refill mines, when they're completely rubbed flush with the holder.
