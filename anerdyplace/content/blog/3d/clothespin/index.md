# Currently
I'm having a lot of fun designing clothespins with compliant mechanisms.

It all started when I wanted to try FreeCAD and needed something to design. And somehow, the idea came to me.

# The first two
were easy. They are inspired by Ikea clothespins. I made a regular version and a slim version. Both are currently 3D printed in PLA and in use, and they still work. You just have to be careful. If you open them too wide, they won't close completely. I will eventually test them with other materials.

# The second version
is inspired by a clamp I saw somewhere. I designed it so that it can be fully opened without damaging the clamp. Even when printed in PLA, it works very well.

# What's next?
I definitely have more clamps planned because I'm really enjoying this. And I will continue to use compliant mechanisms because I think they're awesome.
