# The Challenge

Kaggle's BirdCLEF2024 competition challenges participants to identify bird species from audio recordings collected globally. Utilizing extensive datasets and advanced machine learning techniques, the goal is to enhance automated bird sound recognition. This competition not only aids in biodiversity monitoring but also supports conservation efforts by improving tools for ecologists and ornithologists.

For more detailed information, check out the [BirdCLEF 2024 competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2024).

# Background

This project is conducted as part of the Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab seminar at the University of Passau.

Focusing on the development of a robust AI model for bird classification, the project includes regular progress presentations, team discussions, and collaborative work on a shared repository.

The team comprises [Spencer Apeadjei-Duodu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adkspence/) and myself. Our aim is to advance AI capabilities in ornithology, contributing to broader ecological studies and conservation initiatives. Regular updates and team interactions ensure consistent progress and innovation throughout the project duration.
