# Fixing Watch Hands

I thought to myself today, "I'll fix my watch." It's an old Casio AW-5 with module 1301.

I've had this watch since I was a child and recently found it in a box with my old stuff.
Over the years and with use, the hands have gotten slightly misaligned. The hour and minute hands no longer meet at 12 o'clock, but somewhere else. It didn't look nice.
I thought there wasn't much to lose with this old watch, so I decided to quickly repair it myself.

# Tool design

For that, I designed and 3D printed the necessary tools in FreeCAD. That saved me a few euros.

The tools include 2 levers to lift the watch hands and a press tool to put them back on.
To give it the necessary spice, I designed the press tubes as 1/4" bit inserts.

Can be downloaded on Thingiverse: [Watch Tools](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6649535)

Since I had already disassembled the watch, I also cleaned it and oiled the seal.
Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures throughout the whole process :D So you'll just have to take my word for it.

# Final result

Here's a picture of the repaired watch.

Yes I know, I could have chosen a better time, but believe me, the hands are now perfectly aligned. ;)
