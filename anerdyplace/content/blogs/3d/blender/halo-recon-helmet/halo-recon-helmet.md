# That one time I modelled my own head ...

..was creepy.

## It all started

with me getting into cosplay. Cosplay was always the thing I did know existed, but wasn't really sure what to think of it. Until I got invited to a convention.

I've gone all out and built a whole plate armor for my girlfriend. She cosplayed Erza from fairy tail.

I made it all from EVA foam, Arylic paint and Latex. With the simplest tools: A cutter knife and a dremel.

I also made Erzas winged sword. Totally LARP conform. With a fiber glass rod in the middle, enough cusion and a soft tip.
That way we could take it inside and run around the convention without getting any problems at all.

I did go as Mystogan. My girlfriend made the clothing and I made all his staffs.

It was fun and I got tons of compliments for my builds, which pushed me good and was great for my ego. :D

We went to another convention not long after that and there I saw some guys with halo mjolnir suits.
And I thought to myself: why didn't I think of that?
It is my most favorite game of all time and reminds me of my childhood.

So the plan was settled.

## I always wanted a 3D printer

and now I had the excuse to buy one. I wanted to build my own mjolnir and I wanted to print it myself.

I decided to do the Recon Armor, since I didn't want to look the same as everyone else and I always liked the looks of it in Halo multiplayer.

The Ender 3 Pro was on sale for 160€, so I gave it a shot.
It arrived 2 days after and the assembly was easy and intuitive. I totally can recommend this printer, since it's awesome.

I made sure to assemble everything to the best. I mesured all the party, made all the angles perfect 90°, I modified the z-achsis holder and drilled a few new holes, so that I could adjust the x-achsis to my liking.

(I think I make a complete post about just that.)

I had no experience, but the PLA printed fine. But I wanted my cosplay parts to be more durable, excpecially in a car during the summer. So I ordered some PETG.

It wasn't that easy at first, but I got it to work. The stringing was less of a probleme, more was the adhesion of the print to the stock printbed. (I will also inlclude this in the other post.)
I figured that it's mainly the setup of the printer that decides over how the prints turn out and less the settings of the slicer.

## I got the helmet

model from thingiverse. It was a happy coincidence, that someone made the exact helmet I wanted to print as a 3D model.

But it wasnt perfect. It clearly wasn't meant as a helmet you could really wear on your head.
So I had to to some tweaks to make it work.
