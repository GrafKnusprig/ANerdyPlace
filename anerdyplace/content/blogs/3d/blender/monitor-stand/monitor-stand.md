# I wanted a vertical monitor

But I only had an old ACER G236HL left, which neither has a Vesa mount nor an adjustable stand.

Of course, I had to solve this problem with 3D printed parts. Building a complete monitor stand where the screen is placed like a tablet is too common.
So, I needed something better.

I took a closer look at the original stand and thought that I could easily reuse it.
The only thing I needed was the right profile for the mounting bracket and then a part where the monitor can stand.

So, I started with the

# Construction

This time not in FreeCAD, but again in Blender. Since I didn't know where exactly I was going with this, I wanted to start with a few objects and then progress further.
Unfortunately, you don't have this freedom in FreeCAD (even though the name suggests it).

For this, I used the Blender addon [Bool Tool](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/object/bool_tools.html).
It performs boolean operations much faster, better, and cleaner than if you start tinkering with modifiers yourself.

The result is quite impressive.

# With the result

I am more than satisfied. Yes, in the end the monitor stands in its holder like a tablet in a stand. :D But hey! I'm using the original stand and together with the
part printed in Galaxy Black, it's quite nice to look at and looks almost original.

As a little bonus, the tilt angle can also still be adjusted thanks to the original stand. (Just not too far forward or it will fall out)
But you could also screw the stand to the monitor housing. For those of you who like it really hard core.
