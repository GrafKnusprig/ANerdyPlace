## How it came to this
3 weeks ago the turbo in my car broke.
To save money, I got a revised one on eBay.
After a week of delivery and 2 days in the workshop, the elation of success was immediately followed by great disillusionment.
As soon as I turned on the ignition, a strange humming sound came from the engine compartment.
A short test drive confirmed the suspicion: The boost control does not work.

In order to have a warranty claim, it had to be proven that the turbocharger was faulty and that there was no damage to the vehicle.
The troubleshooting began.

- Oil was changed during turbo replacement
- New oil and air filter was installed
- DPF was cleaned
- Voltage supply was checked
- Signal at boost pressure regulator was checked
- The error memory was read and the static error code 44CC was found: Boost pressure controller defective

The reading of the actuator signal was the trickiest part.
A test wire was inserted into pin 4 of the turbocharger connector and measured against ground using an oscilloscope.
