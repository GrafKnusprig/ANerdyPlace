_Intro_

G6sus2

Am C G6 x3

G6sus2

_Verse 1_

[Am]I'm waking up[C] to ash and dust[G]

I wipe my brow[D] and I sweat my rust[Am]

I'm breathing in[C] the chemicals[G]

(Gasp)[D]

[Am]I'm breaking in[C], shaping up[G], then checking out[D] on the prison bus[Am]

This is it[C], the apocalypse[G]

Whoa[D]

_Chorus 1_

I'm waking [Am]up, I feel it [C]in my bones

En[G]ough to make my [D]systems blow

[Am]Welcome to the new age, [C]to the new age

[G]Welcome to the new age, [D]to the new age

[Am]Whoa-oh-oh, [C]whoa-oh I'm - [G]radioactive, [D]radioactive

[Am]Whoa-oh-oh, [C]whoa-oh I'm - [G]radioactive, [D]radioactive
